The `identity` directory contains all of the common logos and **Missing e** identifiers, used by all platform versions of **Missing e**.

When building, this directory should be linked into the various extensions:

* `chrome/identity` -> `identity`
* `firefox/missinge/data/identity` -> `identity`
* `missinge.safariextension/identity` -> `identity`
