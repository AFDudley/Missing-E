<a name="bookmark-issue" /><p class="question">Why does loading a bookmarked post sometimes loads the dash at the wrong post or the post immediately before the correct one?</p>
<div class="response"><p>Some blogs (especially secondary tumblrs) do not behave correctly on your Tumblr dashboard. They may appear in your feed for a time, but after a while you may no longer be able to scroll to them. The posts are still visible on the Tumblr's personal page, but not on the dashboard.</p><p>Both <em>Bookmarker</em> and <em>Goto Dash Post</em> may instead bring you to the next earliest post by someone that you follow.</p><div class="totop"><a href="#">Top</a></div></div>
<a name="magnifier-use" /><p class="question">How do I use Magnifier? Where is it?</p>
<div class="response"><p><em>Magnifier</em> adds a small <img src="images/magnifier-icon.png" alt="Magnifier icon" /> icon to all photo posts on the dashboard. Simply click on it to view the full-size image without ever leaving the dashboard. <em>Magnifier</em> will resize the image to fit on your screen, but you can click on the enlarged image to open it in a new tab or window.</p><p>The <em>Magnifier</em> icon is also added to <strong>photoset</strong> posts. When you click on it, the enlarged images will appear as a slideshow you can navigate with arrow buttons on either side.</p>
<div class="totop"><a href="#">Top</a></div></div>
<a name="magnifier-load" /><p class="question">Why does the magnifier sometimes look like this <img src="images/magnifier_err.png" alt="Magnifier error icon" /> icon?</p>
<div class="response"><p>In order to get the location of a photo post's highest resolution image, <em>Magnifier</em> has to make a call to the Tumblr API. During times when Tumblr is very busy or error-prone, the API may not work correctly. <em>Magnifier</em> will retry a few times before giving up and showing the <img src="images/magnifier_err.png" alt="Magnifier error icon" /> error icon.</p><p>You can click on the <img src="images/magnifier_err.png" alt="Magnifier error icon" /> icon to tell <em>Magnifier</em> to try again.</p><div class="totop"><a href="#">Top</a></div></div>
<a name="magnifier-resized" /><p class="question">Why is the enlarged photo still not full size?</p>
<div class="response"><p>Photos enlarged by <em>Magnifier</em> are shown scaled down so that they fit into your browser window. You can click on the enlarged photo to open it in its own tab or window at full size.</p><div class="totop"><a href="#">Top</a></div></div>
<a name="magnifier-full" /><p class="question">How can I open the full-size photo in its own tab or window?</p>
<div class="response"><p>You can click on any photo enlarged by <em>Magnifier</em> to open it in its own tab or window at full size.</p><div class="totop"><a href="#">Top</a></div></div>
<a name="newtabs" /><p class="question">I don't want 'Missing e' to open up all these new tabs. How do I stop it?</p>
<div class="response"><p>In the settings (which you can access <a href="#settings">like this</a>), under the <em>Dashboard Features</em> tab, in the <em>Dash Links to Tabs</em> section, you can change this behaviour.</p>
<p><strong>You can:</strong></p>
<ul><li>turn the tab-opening feature on/off <em>completely</em> (by clicking the toggle switch)</li>
<li>turn the tab-opening feature on/off for the <em>new post buttons</em> at the top of your dashboard</li>
<li>turn the tab-opening feature on/off for <em>links in the sidebar</em> (on the right side of the dashboard)</li>
</ul>
<div class="totop"><a href="#">Top</a></div></div>
<a name="safedash-disable" /><p class="question">What is the difference between turning Safe Dash off on the dashboard and turning it off on the 'Missing e' settings screen?</p>
<div class="response"><p>Turning <em>Safe Dash</em> on and off with the link in the sidebar of your dashboard hides and unhides images immediately.</p><p>Deactivating <em>Safe Dash</em> on the 'Missing e' settings screen disables it completely. Any tumblr dashboard page loaded with <em>Safe Dash</em> disabled will not have the <em>Safe Dash</em> toggle button in the sidebar. All images will be shown, as normal.</p><div class="totop"><a href="#">Top</a></div></div>
<a name="safedash-where" /><p class="question">Which images are hidden with Safe Dash and which images are not?</p>
<div class="response">
<p><strong>These images are hidden:</strong></p>
<ul><li>All image posts</li><li>All photoset thumbnails</li><li>Photosets that have been clicked (enlarged)</li><li>Inline images in other types of posts</li><li>Album art in audio posts</li><li>All video thumbnails</li><li>All full-size videos (except videos from external sites)</li></ul>
<p><strong>These images are NOT hidden:</strong></p>
<ul><li>All tumblr-generated user avatars</li><li>Externally-loaded videos (YouTube, Vimeo, etc)</li><li>Images enlarged by the 'Missing e' <em>Magnifier</em> feature.</li></ul>
<div class="totop"><a href="#">Top</a></div></div>
<a name="timestamps-wrongtime" /><p class="question">Why are some posts shown with the incorrect time?</p>
<div class="response">
<p><em>Timestamps</em> uses the Tumblr API to get the time of a post. Unfortunately, Tumblr is known to sometimes report the time of a post incorrectly, often several hours after it was actually posted. For posts where Tumblr is incorrect, <em>Timestamps</em> will also be incorrect.</p>
<div class="totop"><a href="#">Top</a></div></div>
<a name="timestamps-load" /><p class="question">Why do timestamps sometimes fail to load?</p>
<div class="response">
<p><em>Timestamps</em> uses the Tumblr API to get the time of a post. During periods when Tumblr is very busy or error-prone, the API may not work correctly. <em>Timestamps</em> will retry a few times before giving up and displaying: <em><strong>Timestamp loading failed. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Retry</span></strong></em>.</p><p>You can click on '<strong>Retry</strong>' to tell <em>Timestamps</em> to try again.</p>
<div class="totop"><a href="#">Top</a></div></div>
<a name="goto-issue" /><p class="question">Why does clicking on the "Goto Dash" icon of some posts bring me to the wrong post on the dashboard, or the post immediately before the correct one?</p>
<div class="response"><p>Some blogs (especially secondary tumblrs) do not behave correctly on your Tumblr dashboard. They may appear in your feed for a time, but after a while you may no longer be able to scroll to them. The posts are still visible on the Tumblr's personal page, but not on the dashboard.</p><p>Both <em>Bookmarker</em> and <em>Goto Dash Post</em> may instead bring you to the next earliest post by someone that you follow.</p>
<div class="totop"><a href="#">Top</a></div></div>
<a name="uploader-load" /><p class="question">Why is the '+ Upload Photo' button not showing up on a new post or edit post page?</p>
<div class="response">
<p>Much like the '+ Upload Photo' button that Tumblr places on new text post pages by default, <em>Posting Fixes</em> must load an additional Tumblr page in the background before adding the button. During times when Tumblr is very busy or error-prone, this page may not load.</p><p>Try reloading the post page to try again.</p>
<div class="totop"><a href="#">Top</a></div></div>
<a name="reblog-load" /><p class="question">Why do the reblog links for some of my posts in the dashboard show up like this: <del><strong>reblog</strong></del>  (or <span class="MissingE_post_control MissingE_reblog_control MissingE_reblog_control_retry" style="margin-left:0px"></span>)?</p>
<div class="response">
<p>In order to add a reblog link to your posts on the dashboard, <em>Reblog Yourself</em> has to make a call to the Tumblr API. During times when Tumblr is very busy or error-prone, the API may not work correctly. <em>Reblog Yourself</em> will retry a few times before giving up and showing: <strong><del>reblog</del></strong>.</p><p>You can click on the <strong><del>reblog</del></strong> text to tell <em>Reblog Yourself</em> to try again. If it shows up without the strikethrough (ie. '<strong>reblog</strong>'), then the link works!</p><p>You should note that the reblog button added to individual post pages (not on the dashboard) is more or less unaffected by Tumblr API problems.</p>
<div class="totop"><a href="#">Top</a></div></div>
<a name="followchecker-how" /><p class="question">How do I use Follow Checker? Where is it?</p>
<div class="response">
<p>You can use <em>Follow Checker</em> by clicking on the <strong>&rho;</strong> (Greek letter rho) symbol beside your follower count on any dashboard page. The <strong>&rho;</strong> is hidden until you place your mouse on or next to your follower count.</p>
<div class="totop"><a href="#">Top</a></div></div>
<a name="followchecker-fail" /><p class="question">Why does Follow Checker fail to load?</p>
<div class="response">
<p><em>Follow Checker</em> must load every single one of your follower AND following pages behind the scenes. This can take a while, especially if you follow or are followed by a lot of tumblr accounts. During times when Tumblr is very busy or error-prone, one or more of these pages may fail to load. <em>Follow Checker</em> will retry a few times before giving up and returning an error screen.</p>
<div class="totop"><a href="#">Top</a></div></div>
<a name="followchecker-issues" /><p class="question">Why is Follow Checker reporting that I am not following someone that I actually am?</p><p class="question">Why is Follow Checker reporting that someone is not following me even though I know they are?</p>
<div class="response">
<p>Unfortunately, Tumblr sometimes does not show all of your followers or accounts you follow on the follower/following pages. Some may be missing from one or both of these lists.</p><p><em>Follow Checker</em> presents information purely for entertainment purposes. Before you take any rash actions based on information you get from it, you would be wise to double-check whether or not you follow someone or they follow you.</p>
<div class="totop"><a href="#">Top</a></div></div>
<a name="followchecker-rho" /><p class="question">Why is Follow Checker represented by a '&rho;' (rho)?</p>
<div class="response">
<p>The <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rho">Greek letter <strong>&rho;</strong> (rho)</a> is used in statistics to represent the coefficient of correlation between two or more random variables. It is used in <em>Follow Checker</em> to refer to the relationship of tumblrs you follow to tumblrs that follow you.</p>
<div class="totop"><a href="#">Top</a></div></div>
<a name="replies-how" /><p class="question">How do I reply to a reply (or other notification)?</p>
<div class="response">
<p>You can reply to notifications that show up directly on your dashboard. To see these, you must have the 'Show notifications' option turned on in your Tumblr <a href="http://www.tumblr.com/preferences" target="_blank">preferences</a>.</p><p>Simply click on the notifcation icon on the right side of one of these notifications (heart, reply arrow, etc) to open a new post with the notification already added, ready for you to comment on.</p>
<div class="example"><img src="images/examples/notification.png" alt="Sample Tumblr notification" /><div class="caption">Sample Tumblr dashboard notification</div></div>
<p>Please note that (at the moment) you can only reply to dashboard notifications like the one pictured above. Also, <em>if you have any custom styles on your browser</em> that hide the notification icon like the one you see here, you won't be able to reply automatically with <em>Reply Replies</em>.</p>
<div class="totop"><a href="#">Top</a></div></div>
<a name="replies-inner" /><p class="question">Why can't I reply to replies (or other notifications) inside a post's notes list?</p>
<div class="response">
<p>Currently, this is not implemented in 'Missing e'. You can only reply to notifications on your dashboard. See <a href=#replies-how">here</a>.</p>
<div class="totop"><a href="#">Top</a></div></div>
<a name="replies-multi" /><p class="question">How do I reply to more than one notification at once?</p>
<div class="response">
<ol><li>Hold down the <img class="inlineimg" src="images/shift.gif" alt="Shift"> key and click on the icons of each of the notifications you want to reply to.</li><li>Click (without <img class="inlineimg" src="images/shift.gif" alt="Shift">) on the icon of the last notification you want to include.</li><li>All the notifications will appear in a single post in chronological order!</li></ol>
<div class="totop"><a href="#">Top</a></div></div>
<a name="unfollower-how" /><p class="question">How do I use Unfollower? Where is it?</p>
<div class="response">
<p>You can use <em>Unfollower</em> by clicking on the <strong>&Delta;</strong> (Greek letter delta) symbol beside your follower count on any dashboard page. The <strong>&Delta;</strong> is hidden until you place your mouse on or next to your follower count.</p>
<div class="totop"><a href="#">Top</a></div></div>
<a name="unfollower-fail" /><p class="question">Why does Unfollower fail to load?</p>
<div class="response">
<p><em>Unfollower</em> must load every single one of your follower pages behind the scenes. This can take a while, especially if you are followed by a lot of tumblr accounts. During times when Tumblr is very busy or error-prone, one or more of these pages may fail to load. <em>Unfollower</em> will retry a few times before giving up and returning an error screen.</p>
<div class="totop"><a href="#">Top</a></div></div>
<a name="unfollower-issues" /><p class="question">Why does Unfollower report that someone has unfollowed that I know has not?</p>
<div class="response">
<p>First of all, <em>Unfollower</em> displays all tumblr accounts that have either unfollowed you, been deactivated or have changed usernames. It cannot determine the difference in these situations.</p><p>Also, Tumblr, unfortunately, sometimes does not show all of your followers on the follower pages. Some may be missing from the list <em>Unfollower</em> receives from Tumblr.</p><p><em>Unfollower</em> presents information purely for entertainment purposes. Before you take any rash actions based on information you get from it, you would be wise to double-check whether or not someone still follows you.</p>
<div class="totop"><a href="#">Top</a></div></div>
<a name="unfollower-secondary" /><p class="question">Can Unfollower track your unfollows on multiple tumblr accounts?</p>
<div class="response">
<p>No, <em>Unfollower</em> cannot track unfollows on more than one tumblr account at a time. If you use <em>Unfollower</em> on one account and then try again on another, the results may not make sense.</p><p>Also note that the first time you load a Tumblr dashboard page after installing 'Missing e', <em>Unfollower</em> automatically loads your follower list. The first time your run <em>Unfollower</em> manually, it will use this list. If the first dashboard page you loaded was for a secondary tumblr account, the first report may not make sense.</p>
<div class="totop"><a href="#">Top</a></div></div>
<a name="unfollower-delta" /><p class="question">Why is Unfollower represented by a '&Delta;' (delta)?</p>
<div class="response">
<p>The <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_(letter)" target="_blank">Greek letter &Delta; (delta)</a> is used in many fields of science and engineering to represent change.</p>
