<h2 id="answers">Answers</h2>
<a name="nottumblr"></a><p class="question">Is the 'Missing e' browser extension affiliated with or endorsed by Tumblr?</p>
<div class="response">
<p>No, the 'Missing e' browser extension/add-on is not affiliated with Tumblr, Inc. in any way. Its features are intended to improve the ease of use of that site, but it is neither approved nor endorsed by Tumblr, Inc. That being said, as an unofficial extension for Tumblr, 'Missing e' is proud to do what it can to enhance your enjoyment of the microblogging experience.</p>
<p>By downloading and using this extension, you agree to the terms and conditions set forth in the <a href="/EULA.txt" target="_blank">Missing e End User License Agreement</a></p>
<div class="totop"><a href="#">Top</a></div></div>
<a name="changes"></a><p class="question">Where can I see a list of changes made to 'Missing e' in a recent version?</p>
<div class="response"><p>You can see a full list of changes (features added, fixed or removed) in the <a href="http://github.missing-e.com/changes">Change History</a> page. You might also consider following <a href="http://blog.missing-e.com">'Missing e' on Tumblr</a> for news and information about the extension.</p>
<div class="totop"><a href="#">Top</a></div></div>
<a name="apiissues"></a><p class="question">What happened to the Follow Checker feature?</p>
<p class="question">What happened to the Unfollower feature?</p>
<div class="response">
<p>Recently, Tumblr began to enforce an <a href="http://www.tumblr.com/policy/en/api">API License Agreement</a> which prohibits the use of many of the features of 'Missing e'. In order to continue distributing 'Missing e' and preserve as many useful features as possible, all those that depended on the Tumblr API (and those which put excessive strain on Tumblr's servers) were removed as of 'Missing e' version 2.0.0.</p>
<p>Almost all features were preserved or modified (with little to no perceivable impact) to acheive this goal. However, <em>Follow Checker</em> and <em>Unfollower</em> were removed from 'Missing e'.</p>
<p>We apologize for the inconvenience that affects users who depended on these features. However, I hope you will understand that these sacrifices were made so that you may continue to use and receive new versions of 'Missing e'.</p>
<div class="totop"><a href="#">Top</a></div></div>
<a name="warning"></a><p class="question">A warning came up on Tumblr saying 'Missing e' could cause problems on my blog, expose me to hacking or access my private information. Is this true?</p>
<p class="question">I've heard that using 'Missing e' could get your Tumblr account or posts deleted. Is this just a rumour?</p>
<div class="response">
<p>You may have seen a warning message put out by Tumblr, suggesting that 'Missing e' is a browser "hack" that could cause problems for your account. Rest assured that 'Missing e' is completely safe. Using it <em>will not</em> cause your account or any of your posts to be deleted! The only change is that Tumblr will not provide technical help for your account while you are using 'Missing e'.</p>
<p>The issues Tumblr mentions in their warning are a worst-case scenario for installing browser extensions, scripts or modifications of any kind. However, 'Missing e' is not a source of these kinds of problems.</p>
<p class="singleline"><strong>Data Loss</strong></p>
<p>It is very unlikely that 'Missing e' will cause any data loss. This is especially true of existing posts. Without your interaction, 'Missing e' <em>will not</em> delete anything!</p>
<p class="singleline"><strong>Privacy / Private Information</strong></p>
<p>'Missing e' does not obtain, use or store your email address, password, IP address, search queries or contents of any of your existing posts.</p>
<p>There is a <a href="http://blog.missing-e.com/post/6005505122/permissions">useful Tumblr post</a> that explains what browser extension permissions 'missing e' uses, explaining many of the security notifications you get when installing the extension. <a href="http://blog.missing-e.com/post/6005505122/permissions">Click here to learn about that</a>.</p>
<p class="singleline"><strong>Page Scraping</strong></p>
<p>'Missing e' implements only a small amount of what Tumblr calls <em>page scraping</em>. It is not done regularly, nor is it excessive. With it, you have access to features like adding your sidebar to all dashboard pages, seeing timestamps of messages in your inbox and being able to reblog yourself from the dashboard.</p>

<hr />
<p>All users are encouraged to <a href="https://github.com/jcutler/Missing-E" target="_blank" title="Missing e on Github">examine the 'Missing e' source code</a> to confirm all of these claims.</p>
<p>If you have any questions about specific problems you've heard are related to 'Missing e' or about the extension in general, you are welcome to <a href="http://blog.missing-e.com/ask">drop by the 'Missing e' askbox</a>. If you are still uncomfortable with using 'Missing e', please feel free to uninstall it (<a href="http://missing-e.com/faq#uninstall">instructions</a>).</p>

<a name="permissions"></a><p class="question">The Chrome Web Store (or other download page) has a lot of warnings about what 'Missing e' could do on my computer. Is it safe to install?</p>
<div class="response">
<p>Browser extensions need to ask for certain permissions from your browser in order for many features to work. Please read <a href="http://blog.missing-e.com/post/6005505122/permissions">this post on Tumblr</a> for an explanation of the permissions 'Missing e' uses and why.</p>

<div class="response">
<p>This error is almost always a result of the installed version of Google Chrome being too old. In the Google Chrome menu (the little wrench icon at the top of your browser), click on <em>"About Google Chrome"</em>. The window that pops up will check for available updates to your browser and allow you to manually apply the update. Once you have updated Chrome, you should be able to install 'Missing e'.</p>

<a name="disable"></a><p class="question">'Missing e' stopped working on my Tumblr dashboard. How do I fix it?</p>
<div class="response">
<p>For some reason, a small number of users find that the 'Missing e' browser extension can stop working without warning. In order to fix this, it is <em>not necessary</em> to uninstall and reinstall the extension! Instead, all you need to do is to disable and re-enable 'Missing e' in your browser's extensions/add-ons list. Here's how:</p>
<p class="singleline"><strong>Google Chrome</strong></p>
<p>In the Google Chrome menu (the wrench icon at the top right of the browser), go to <em>"Tools"</em> and click on <em>"Extensions"</em>. Once in your extensions list, find the entry for 'Missing e' and uncheck the checkbox labelled <em>"Enabled"</em>. Then, click the same checkbox again to re-enable it. Once complete, reload your Tumblr dashboard to continue using 'Missing e' features.</p>
<div class="example"><img src="images/examples/chrome-disable.png" alt="Disabling/Re-Enabling Missing e in Chrome" /></div>
<p class="singleline"><strong>Apple Safari</strong></p>
<p>Open the Safari menu:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Mac OSX:</strong> click <em>"Safari"</em> in the menu bar at the top of the screen</li>
<li><strong>Windows:</strong> click on the gear icon at the top right of the window, just under the close button</li></ul>
<p>In the Safari menu, go to <em>"Preferences"</em>. Select the <em>"Extensions"</em> tab. In the list of extensions, click 'Missing e'. Uncheck the checkbox labelled <em>"Enable Missing e"</em>, then click the same checkbox again to re-enable it. Once complete, reload your Tumblr dashboard to continue using 'Missing e' features.</p>
<div class="example"><img src="images/examples/safari-disable.png" alt="Disabling/Re-Enabling Missing e in Safari" /></div>
<p class="singleline"><strong>Mozilla Firefox</strong></p>
<p>In the Firefox menu, go to <em>"Tools"</em> and click on <em>"Add-ons"</em>. Once in your add-ons list, find the entry for 'Missing e' and click the button labelled <em>"Disable"</em>. Then, click the same button which is now labelled <em>"Enable"</em> to re-enable it. Once complete, reload your Tumblr dashboard to continue using 'Missing e' features.</p>

<a name="uninstall"></a><p class="question">'Missing e' isn't working out for me. How do I uninstall it?</p>
<div class="response">
<p>We're sorry to hear that! Don't forget, if there are certain features you don't like and others you do, you can customize 'Missing e' and only use the features you want. <a href="#featurecontrol">Find out how</a>.</p>
<p>If you still want to uninstall, follow these instructions:</p>
<p><strong>Google Chrome</strong></p>
<ul><li>In the menu (the little wrench icon at the top of your browser), go to <em>"Tools"</em> &gt; <em>"Extensions"</em> and click on <em>"Uninstall"</em> in the 'Missing e' section.</li></ul>

<ul><li>Open the Safari menu<ul><li><strong>Mac OSX:</strong> click <em>"Safari"</em> in the menu bar at the top of the screen</li><li><strong>Windows:</strong> click on the gear icon at the top right of the window, just under the close button</li></ul></li><li>In the Safari menu, go to <em>"Preferences"</em>. Select the <em>"Extensions"</em> tab. In the list of extensions, click 'Missing e', then hit the "Uninstall" button.</li></ul>
<p><strong>Mozilla Firefox</strong></p>
<ul><li>In the menu, go to <em>"Tools"</em> &gt; <em>"Add-ons"</em>. In the list of add-ons, find 'Missing e' and click on its "Remove" button.</li></ul>
<div class="totop"><a href="#">Top</a></div></div>
<a name="update"></a><p class="question">How do I update 'Missing e' to the newest version?</p>
<div class="response">
<p class="singleline"><strong>Google Chrome</strong></p>
<p>Google Chrome extensions should update automatically on a somewhat regular basis. If you would like to <em>force</em> Chrome to update 'Missing e' now, follow these instructions:</p>
<p>In the Google Chrome menu (the wrench icon at the top right of the browser), go to <em>"Tools"</em> and click on <em>"Extensions"</em>. Once in your extensions list, click the <em>"Developer mode"</em> button on the right-hand side.</p>
<div class="example"><img src="images/examples/chrome-update-1.png" alt="Activate Developer mode" /></div>
<p>Then, click the <em>"Update extensions now"</em> button.</p>

<p>You have successfully updated 'Missing e'. Reload any Tumblr tabs you have open to take advantage of features in the new version</p>
<p class="singleline"><strong>Apple Safari</strong></p>
<p>If Safari is configured to update extensions automatically, extensions should be updated on a somewhat regular basis. If it is not configured to do so, or you wish to <em>force</em> Safari to update 'Missing e' now, follow these instructions:</p>
<p>In the Apple Safari <em>Preferences</em> window (which you can open from the Safari menu), click on the <em>"Extensions"</em> pane. Your list of installed extensions appears at the left. Click on the <em>"Updates"</em> button to show available extension updates.</p>
<div class="example"><img src="images/examples/safari-update-1.png" alt="Safari Preferences, Extensions pane" /></div>
<p>Click on the <em>"Install All Updates"</em> button to update all of your extensions. If you wish to only update 'Missing e', find it in the list of avaialable updates and click on the <em>"Install"</em> button beside the 'Missing e' icon.</p>
<div class="example"><img src="images/examples/safari-update-2.png" alt="Update extensions" /></div>
<p class="singleline"><strong>Mozilla Firefox</strong></p>
<p>Firefox should update extensions automatically. However, the newest versions of 'Missing e' may not be immediately updated until they are reviewed by the Mozilla Add-ons site. If you wish to <em>force</em> Firefox to update to the newest version of 'Missing e' now, follow these instructions:</p>
<ul><li>Go to the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/missing-e/versions/"><em>'Missing e' Version History</em> page</a> on the Mozilla Add-ons site.</li>
<li>Simply click on the <em>"Add to Firefox"</em> button next to the newest version (the one at the top of the list)</li></ul>

<div class="response"><p>The <em>Better Reblogs</em> feature can automatically keep the tags from a post when you reblog it. To support this on individual post pages, <em>Better Reblogs</em> must get the tags from the Tumblr RSS feed.

<a name="scroll"></a><p class="question">What are the <em>endless scroll</em> "prevent stalling" and "timeout" options for?</p>
<div class="response">
<p>The Tumblr dashboard has an "<strong>endless scroll</strong>" feature that automatically loads the next page of posts for you when you get to the bottom of the dashboard.</p>
<div class="example">
<img src="images/examples/scroll_loading.png" alt="Endless Scroll loading" />
<div class="caption">"<strong>Endless Scroll</strong>" loading a new page of posts</div>
</div>
<p>Normally, if an "<strong>endless scroll</strong>" load fails, it should try a second time. If it fails again, it should say it has failed and a display a "Try again" button you can click on to force it to retry.</p>
<div class="example">
<img src="images/examples/scroll_failed.png" alt="Endless Scroll failed" />
<div class="caption">"<strong>Endless Scroll</strong>" fails</div>
</div>
<p>There are two shortcomings with the "<strong>endless scroll</strong>" feature that <em>Dashboard Tweaks</em> can improve:</p>
<p class="singleline"><strong>1. There is no timeout</strong></p>
<ul><li>If a load stalls for a long time, Tumblr's "<strong>endless scroll</strong>" feature will just keep waiting, possibly indefinitely.</li></ul>
<p>The 'Missing e' <em>Dashboard Tweaks</em> feature will force loads that are taking too long to stop, allowing you to try again. In the settings (which you can access <a href="#settings">like this</a>) you can specify how long you want that timeout to be. After waiting one timeout length, it will force "<strong>endless scroll</strong>" to try again. After another timeout length, it will give up and display the "Try again" button.</p>
<p>For example, if the timeout is set to 15 seconds, Tumblr will try to load the next page once, give up after 15 seconds, try again, give up again after 15 seconds and then display the "Try again" button.</p>
<p>Don't set the timeout to <em>too short a length</em>, or it may cause loads that would have succeeded to stop early!</p>

<a name="shuffle-limit"></a><p class="question">Why does the <em>Shuffle</em> button not randomize all the posts in my queue (including ones not currently on the page)?</p>

During times when Tumblr is very busy or error-prone, this may not work correctly. <em>Timestamps</em> will retry a few times (specified in your settings) before giving up and displaying: <em><strong>Timestamp loading failed. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Retry</span></strong></em>.</p><p>You can click on '<strong>Retry</strong>' to tell <em>Timestamps</em> to try again.</p>

<a name="experimental-reblogReplies"></a><p class="question">Why is the <span>"Allow replies to reblogs"</span> setting experimental?</p>
<div class="response">
<div class="experimental-details"><p>This setting is part of a set of <em>experimental</em> features in 'Missing e'.</p><p>It is <em>experimental</em> because it is a useful, interesting feature for Tumblr, but it does not work reliably.</p><p>This setting is provided for your use, but <strong>is not supported</strong> and may be <strong>removed from 'Missing e' at any time</strong>, without notice.</p><p>Questions and pleas for help regarding this feature will be ignored!</p></div>
<p>The <em>"Allow replies to reblogs"</em> option does, indeed, allow you to reply to reblogged posts with a button that looks like <strong>[reply]</strong> <em>or</em> <span class="MissingE_post_control MissingE_experimental_reply_control" style="margin-left:0px;"></span>. If the user who reblogged it has their "Show notifications" setting turned on in their Tumblr <a href="http://www.tumblr.com/preferences">preferences</a>, they will <em>most likely</em> receive a notification of your reply. However, your reply <em>may not</em> always show up in the post's notes. Especially if you have also reblogged it, or reblog it after replying.</p>
<p>On top of that, the attempt to reply may not even work at all! When attempting to send a reply, the experimental reply button will be replaced with an <span class="MissingE_post_control MissingE_experimental_reply_success" style="margin-left:0px;"></span> icon, if successful. If the reply fails for some reason, you will see an <span class="MissingE_post_control MissingE_experimental_reply_fail" style="margin-left:0px;"></span> icon.</p>
